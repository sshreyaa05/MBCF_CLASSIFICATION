### MBCF Classification Project: Predicting Missing Ratings Using Decision Tree and Naive Bayes Classifiers
### Overview:
This project focuses on predicting missing ratings in a user-item matrix containing 6 users and 6 items. The task was approached using two different classifiers—Decision Tree and Naive Bayes—to predict the missing ratings based on the existing ones. Both models were trained and tested on the same dataset to evaluate their performance in a collaborative filtering context.

### Results:
Both the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers achieved identical results in predicting the missing ratings, with an accuracy of 1 (100%). This indicates that both models were able to perfectly predict the missing values within the given matrix. Additionally, test predictions were performed using a separate test object to validate the models' predictions.

### Conclusion:
The project demonstrated that both Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classifiers were highly effective in predicting missing ratings for a small-scale user-item matrix. With perfect accuracy achieved by both models, the results suggest that for this dataset size, both algorithms were well-suited for the recommendation task. Future work could involve applying the models to larger datasets for more robust validation.
